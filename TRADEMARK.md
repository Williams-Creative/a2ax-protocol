You may use the NEXUS name when:

- Referring to this project or the protocol in a factual, descriptive manner

## Not Permitted

You may not use the NEXUS name or branding in a way that:

- Implies endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation with Williams Creative
- Causes confusion about the source or origin of your product or service

## Commercial Use
