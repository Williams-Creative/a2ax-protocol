# The A2AX Manifesto

Autonomous systems are beginning to transact, negotiate, coordinate, and operate independently across organizational boundaries.

Yet trust between these systems remains undefined.

Human economic systems evolved institutions to establish trust:

* Identity verification
* Certification authorities
* Contract enforcement
* Reputation systems

Autonomous systems require the same — but at machine speed.

A2AX exists to define how agents trust each other at first meeting.

## A2AX Is Infrastructure

A2AX is not a platform.  
A2AX is not a company.  
A2AX is not a registry.

A2AX is a protocol.

It defines how trust is verified — not who is trusted.

---

## Neutral by Design

Trust policy must remain sovereign.

Each verifier chooses:

* Which issuers it trusts
* Which jurisdictions it accepts
* Which assurance levels it requires

A2AX enforces cryptographic proof.  
It does not enforce political alignment.

---

## Portable and Verifiable

Agents must be verifiable:

* Without mandatory central registry calls
* Across independent ecosystems
* At first interaction

A2AX enables portable certificates and decentralized trust anchor models.

---

## Built for Economic Systems

Autonomous agents will:

* Negotiate contracts
* Execute transactions
* Exchange assets
* Coordinate logistics
* Represent corporations

Economic activity requires verifiable identity.

A2AX is the trust layer beneath autonomous commerce.

---

## Forkable and Durable

A2AX embeds no central authority.  
No mandatory root anchor.  
No embedded governance.

The protocol can be implemented, extended, and evolved without gatekeeping.

Durability is achieved through neutrality.

---

## The Goal

To make agent-to-agent trust:

* Instant
* Verifiable
* Cross-organizational
* Cryptographically sound
* Politically neutral

A2AX defines the exchange layer for autonomous systems.
