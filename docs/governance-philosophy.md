# Governance Philosophy

## A2AX Is Not

- A central authority
- A gatekeeper
- A mandatory registry

## A2AX Is

- A trust verification standard
- A pluggable identity layer
- A neutral infrastructure component
- Commercially extensible

## Principles

1. **Verifier-controlled trust**: Each deployment chooses whom to trust
2. **No embedded anchors**: Empty trust store by default
3. **Portable verification**: Works without registry
4. **Fork-safe**: Protocol compiles and runs independently
5. **Vendor-neutral**: No hardcoded A2AX endpoints or commercial hooks
